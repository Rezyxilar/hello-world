Hello to da world

I am the next Mark Zuckerberg. Except I will rule the world. (Which Mark already does) sooooo. JK Facebook is dead.

I am looking for ways to increase productivity and thus happiness. Video games do not suffice any longer. Currently am proficient in C#. Going back to school at UVU this fall in CS. Wanting to learn Swift to program for Mac/iOS.
